# Elixir DigitalOcean Client #

## Rationale ##

This is the (very!) beginning of a Digital Ocean API wrapper that operates at a higher level than (digoc)[https://github.com/kevinmontuori/digoc].  That library simply makes calls against the API; this library attempts to do smarter things with the data that are returned.

This is a work in progress!  (But if you have ideas, be sure to let me know.)
